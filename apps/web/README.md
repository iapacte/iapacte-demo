# Iapacte Demo - Color Scheme and Medieval Vibes

Iapacte Demo's design embraces a medieval-inspired aesthetic to reflect the centuries-old heritage of city councils, incorporating elements like shields and flags. This style draws from ancient manuscripts, stone castles, and heraldic traditions, achieved through an earthy color palette, textured elements, and serif typography.

## Medieval Vibes and Design Inspiration

The medieval vibe is crafted with:

- **Earthy Color Palette**: Warm, natural tones inspired by aged parchment, forest earth, and royal insignia.
- **Textured Elements**: Subtle shadows and borders reminiscent of carved stone or weathered wood.
- **Typography**: Cinzel for stately display text and Cardo for classic headings/labels, paired with DM Sans for readable body text.

## Assigned Colors

The color scheme, developed using the [Material Design Theme Builder](https://material-foundation.github.io/material-theme-builder/), features the following source colors to evoke a medieval feel:

- **Primary: #A52A2A**  
  A reddish-brown, evoking medieval banners and wooden halls, used for key actions like buttons and highlights.
- **Secondary: #5C4033**  
  A dark brown, resembling aged wood or earth, applied to supporting elements like navigation and icons.
- **Tertiary: #DAA520**  
  A golden yellow, mimicking royal seals and shields, used for accents like tabs or tertiary information.
- **Error: #D2691E**  
  A burnt orange, inspired by urgent medieval warnings, for alerts and error states.
- **Neutral: #D2B48C**  
  A light tan, like parchment or stone walls, serving as the background and surface color.
- **Neutral Variant: #5C4033**  
  A darker brown variant, used for medium emphasis like outlines and dividers, adding depth.

These colors are processed into a full Material Design 3 palette, generating light and dark themes for integration into `apps/web/src/styles/global.css` with Tailwind CSS.
