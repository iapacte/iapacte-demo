# Demo-Only Guidance

## Purpose

The iapacte_validations repository now exists strictly to craft UI-only demos inside `apps/web` for a single in-person sales and feedback session with city councils. Nothing ships to production, no backend calls are required, and every flow can run entirely offline on the presenter's laptop. All work should answer one question: *does this convince councils to adopt Iapacte?*

## Demo Constraints

- Build screens and interactions only in `apps/web`; disable or mock anything that implies real data processing.
- Bundle every use case into one cohesive storyline so presenters can walk through the entire experience in one uninterrupted session.
- Prioritize speed of iteration over technical depth: skip infrastructure, keep APIs stubbed, and lean on mock data fixtures that are easy to tweak shortly before the meeting.
- Ensure the UI behaves deterministically offline to avoid surprises during the live walkthrough.

## Minimum Engineering Setup

- Use the existing toolchain (Nix dev shell + pnpm v9 + React 19 + Tanstack Router + Effect Atom) but strip out unused dependencies where possible to keep installs fast.
- The only command that must work flawlessly is `pnpm --filter @aipacto/apps-web dev`.
- Keep lint (`pnpm lint`) and type checks (`pnpm check-types`) green so that rapid UI tweaks remain safe, even if the backend is mocked.

## Core Demo Use Cases

All demo tracks must showcase these pillars:

1. **Tender & Knowledge Vault** – a single repository for every tender, guideline, legal memo, and internal AI prompt doc so clerks never start from scratch.
2. **AI Workflow Studio** – visual builders for AI + data-source pipelines that the chat UI can dynamically invoke depending on the conversation context.
3. **Friendly Spreadsheet** – an approachable grid (think Teable, NocoDB, Stackby, Baserow) that can read/write any municipal dataset: procurement DBs, open data portals, even auto-parsed local news feeds.

## Storytelling Goals

Focus every commit on better sales storytelling rather than completeness:

- Screen content must highlight tangible wins for clerks, department leads, and citizens—spell out “what success looks like” on the interface itself.
- Prefer guided prompts, empty states, and inline tooltips that explain benefits, because the UI is the only artifact councils see.
- Include applause lines (e.g., “2 weeks saved per permit cycle”) that presenters can read verbatim.

## Suggested Rewrite Tracks

Select one—or branch all three for testing. Each track repackages the same UI primitives around a different narrative emphasis while still covering the three core use cases:

1. **“Tender Compass”** – Position the app as the definitive tender intelligence desk. Start inside the Tender & Knowledge Vault, surface AI prompts that auto-fill procurement drafts, then pivot into the Civic Spreadsheet to show how clauses reference live budget data.
2. **“Orchestrated Intelligence Studio”** – Lead with the AI Workflow Studio: drag-and-drop nodes that blend municipal databases, open datasets, and parsed news. The chat assistant demonstrates how it chooses the right workflow mid-conversation, then logs outcomes back into the vault.
3. **“Urban Data Grid”** – Treat the Friendly Civic Spreadsheet as the hero. Showcase read/write connections to Snowflake-like warehouses plus open-government feeds. Inline AI helpers trigger workflows and link to the tender archive as annotated references.

Document in the PR description which rewrite track you contributed to so the presenter can bundle screens confidently.

## Visual Direction

- Maintain the MD3-inspired medieval aesthetic already defined in `apps/web/src/styles`, but exaggerate hierarchy so it reads clearly on a projector or screen share.
- Use Tailwind tokens exclusively (`p-md`, `gap-sm`, `text-heading-m`, etc.) and ensure color roles remain accessible on light/dark skins.
- Any motion should be purposeful and subtle; the goal is to guide attention, not to show technical prowess.
- Remember the Tanstack Start SSR runtime drives `apps/web`; theme tokens and CSS variables live in `apps/web/src/styles/global.css` and `apps/web/src/styles/themes.css`, so confine visual tweaks there to keep demos consistent.
